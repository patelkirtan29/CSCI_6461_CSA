# CSCI_6461_CSA

## Description
This repository contains a Java implementation of an assembler and a simulator for the Computer System Architecture course (CSCI_6461) at George Washington University. The project converts assembly source files into binary/machine code (assembler) and executes that code in a simulated CPU/memory environment (simulator).
